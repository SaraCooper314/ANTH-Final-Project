# ANTH-Final-Project Tasks
My first step in this project will be to narrow down the list of tombs I intend to feature. These will be those that represent the most significant points of development for the pyramid form. I will need to collect basic information on their structure and build scale models of them in Maya. I will then map them in ArcGIS. Compiling more detailed information on the construction of each pyramid and documenting this on my map will be the last step. The extent of information on each tomb will be largely determined by time constraints. Major challenges with this project will be to orient myself to ArcGIS and figure out how to merge the two technologies Iâ€™m working with.
